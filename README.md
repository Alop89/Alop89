## Some of my projects

### Gym Customer Churn Prediction: A Data-Driven Approach to Retention
In the competitive fitness industry, customer retention is vital for long-term success. Recognizing this, Model Fitness embarked on a project to leverage data analytics and machine learning to predict and prevent customer churn, particularly focusing on members who "fade away" without explicitly canceling their memberships.

### Project Objectives
The goal of this project is to create a data-driven retention strategy by analyzing customer behavior, developing predictive models, and identifying actionable insights. This initiative aims to improve customer experience, optimize marketing efforts, and foster sustainable growth for Model Fitness.

### Key Highlights
Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis (EDA) revealed insights through heatmaps and dendrograms, identifying clusters and correlations between key variables.
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression and Random Forest models were implemented.
Logistic Regression demonstrated superior performance across metrics like Accuracy (0.93), F1 Score (0.86), and AUC-ROC (0.97) compared to Random Forest.
Business Recommendations: Tailored strategies were suggested for different customer clusters, such as flexible memberships, rewards for milestones, and motivational campaigns, aiming to increase loyalty and satisfaction.
Libraries and Tools
Python: For data analysis and machine learning.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
Visualizations: Heatmaps and dendrograms to explore customer segmentation.
Outcomes
This project showcases the power of data in enhancing customer experience and retention. By predicting potential churners and addressing their unique needs, Model Fitness is equipped to foster deeper customer connections and stay ahead in a competitive market.
